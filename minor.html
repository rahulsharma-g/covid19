							<p>Recently, A new disease that occurred in 2019 and that was not known previously in humans was coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a wide variety of viruses that cause respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). The new coronavirus started to spread in China in December 2019 and later spread to many other countries. Deep learning is one of the most helpful methods of artificial intelligence for detecting COVID-19 infections from medical images, such as X-rays, especially when a limited image dataset is accessible. The first screening procedure is a chest X-ray. It plays a major role in COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19 treatment is usually related both to pneumonia symptoms and to chest rays. Chest X-rays have become the first imaging tool to play a significant role. Recently, widely accessible X-rays have not only improved in stable cases but also improved in patients with COVID-19.</p>

                                                         2) Beneficiary Verification: Beneficiary's relevant details can be captured in encrypted form which can be utilized to ensure that health services are administered to relevant Beneficiary.<br>
                                                         3) Aadhaar Authentication: To ensure de-duplication, Beneficiary's Aadhaar authentication can be done from the application in the form of OTP and Demographic Authentication. This is applicable at the time of registration or at the time of validation.<br>
                                                         4) Status: Based on patient history, vaccination status of Beneficiary can be updated from not vaccinated to partially vaccinated and partially vaccinated to vaccination completion.<br>
                                                         5) Reporting of Adverse Event following via communicating with doctors.<br>

							<p>Data collection methods will be employed on several studies based on X-Rays, including analyses of operating methods and accuracy in detecting infection from chest images, particularly  COVID-19. Detection can be based Deep Learning of Artificial Intelligence into a software/Tool to differentiate between COVID-19 and other chest infections like Tuberculosis. For the training dataset, 103 CXR images of COVID-19 were downloaded from GitHub COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset. Five hundred images of non-COVID-19 pneumonia and 500 images of the normal lung were downloaded from the Kaggle RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset. To balance the dataset, we expanded the COVID-19 dataset to 500 images by slight rotation (probability = 1, max rotation = 5) and zooming (probability = 0.5, percentage area = 0.9) of the original images using the Augmentor Python package.  Various Research conducting Organization/Universities like ICMR, IMA, WHO, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Wuhan University, Harvard,<br>
                                                           St nford, John Hopkins, UCLA and Yale, their data and research will also be being analyzed.<br>
                                                           In Gharelu Chikitsa is the Home Remedies section in which user will get knowledge in basic home remedies on common diseases. This helps one to research diagnostic images and recognize potential variations that will result in the illness being immediately identified. In chest X-rays, patients had peculiar conditions. The disease’s symptoms cause breathing issues, cardiac injury, and secondary infection. The results revealed that COVID-19 spreads independently. The infected person must be treated in the intensive care unit when severe respiratory problems occur. Radiography of affected individuals reveals unique features of COVID-19. Therefore, clinical experts need chest X-ray images for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest X-ray studies have found that the COVID-19-related lunar shadowing sensitivity has been reduced by 25% to 69 %. The sensitivity of chest X-rays was 69%.While there are comparatively <br>                                                                                                             limited numbers of cases covered by individual X-rays of COVID-19 patients, a collection of characteristic results shows that the most common lung shifts are concentration of fluid and/or tissue in the lungs preventing gas exchange in the pulmonary alveoli. In addition, the ground glass opacities and shadowing nodules primarily affect the peripheral and lower lung regions. In view of the uncertain data situation, medical societies and professional bodies have aimed to provide advice. In view of this data situation, the focus is on CT. The Radiological Society of North America provided an expert consensus statement that states that CT is not currently recommended for screening to diagnose or exclude COVID-19 .The Fleischer Company confirmed in its statement that chest X-rays are insensitive in the early stages of the disease. Nonetheless,X-ray analysis shows regular lung changes as quarantined patients with severe symptoms are studied.Chest X <br>                                                          -rays may be adequate to evaluate the course of the disease and evaluate pneumonia for other reasons, according to the Fleischer Society’s view, in patients who are already hospitalized. Therefore, for COVID-19 patients in intensive care who are not sufficiently healthy to undergo CT scans, the European Society of Thoracic Imaging (ESTI) and European Society of Radiology (ESR) recommend the use of X-ray imaging.</p>
